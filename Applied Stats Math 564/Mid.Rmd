Question 1)

From the scattered plots we can see that the rental rates(Y) is modarately correlated with operating_expenses(X2) and square_footage(X4).Y is weakly related with age(X1) and vacancy rates(X3).

```{r}
Data=read.table("Commercial_Property.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "");
Y=Data$Y;
X1=Data$X1;
X2=Data$X2;
X3=Data$X3;
X4=Data$X4;


par(mfrow=c(3,2))
pairs(Data) 


```
Question 2)

The model is

$Y=12.220-0.142*X1+0.238*X2+0.619*X3+0.000007*X4$

or

$Y=1.220e+01-1.420e-01*X1+2.820e-01*X2+6.193e-01*X3+7.924e-06*X4$

```{r}
Model1=lm(Y~X1+X2+X3+X4)
Model1

```
Question 3)

In the first plot i.e, residuals against individual predictors, the residuals appears to form a systematic patterns and i.i.d. with normal distribution.

In the second plot i.e, residuals against two factor interaction the systematic pattern for residuals look like i.i.d. normally distributed in X2 x X4 and X1 x X2 interaction terms.

```{r}
plot(Y,Model1$residuals)
abline(0,0)

par(mfrow=c(3,2))

plot(X1,Model1$residuals)
abline(0,0)
plot(X2,Model1$residuals)
abline(0,0)
plot(X3,Model1$residuals)
abline(0,0)
plot(X4,Model1$residuals)
abline(0,0)


par(mfrow=c(3,2))
plot(X1*X2,Model1$residuals)
abline(0,0)
plot(X1*X3,Model1$residuals)
abline(0,0)
plot(X1*X4,Model1$residuals)
abline(0,0)
plot(X2*X3,Model1$residuals)
abline(0,0)
plot(X2*X4,Model1$residuals)
abline(0,0)
plot(X3*X4,Model1$residuals)
abline(0,0)

```
Question 4)

The F ratio is greater than F statistic for all coefficients, so we reject null hypothesis and conclude that none of the coeficients are 0.

```{r}
anova(Model1)

Fs=qf(0.95,1,76)
Fs


```
Question 5)

R Square defines the variance of dependent variable that can be explained by independent variables.

R-squared : 0.5847 #from summary of the model.

Adjusted R-Squared
Adjusted R-Square is similar to R-Squared but it will consider degrees of freedom of the data points also into account because the R-Squared varies a lot if new dependent variables are added.

Adjusted R-squared : 0.5629 #from summary of the model.


```{r}
summary(Model1)
```
Question 6)

The point estimates, 95 percent confidence and prediction intervals for the data points are as follows:

```{r}
Data1=data.frame(X1=4,X2=10,X3=0.1,X4=80000)
Data2=data.frame(X1=6,X2=11.5,X3=0,X4=120000)
Data3=data.frame(X1=12,X2=12.5,X3=0.32,X4=340000)


 writeLines("Confidence Intervals")



predict(Model1, newdata = Data1, interval = "confidence", level=0.95)
predict(Model1, newdata = Data2, interval = "confidence", level=0.95)
predict(Model1, newdata = Data3, interval = "confidence", level=0.95)


writeLines("Prediction Intervals")

predict(Model1, newdata = Data1, interval = "prediction", level=0.95)
predict(Model1, newdata = Data2, interval = "prediction", level=0.95)
predict(Model1, newdata = Data3, interval = "prediction", level=0.95)



```
Question 7)

partial F test

![Partial F Test](C:/Users/SRINU/Desktop/Fall 2022/Stats/Capture.png)

follows $F(dfF - dfr,n-p)$ Distribution

Conclusion: Since F Ratio is less than F statistic we don't reject null hypothesis so $Beta3=0$

```{r}
Model2=lm(Y~X1+X2+X4)
Model2
anova(Model1)
anova(Model2)
#From Anova Tables
SSRF=98.231
SSRR=98.650
dfF=4
dfr=3
MSEf=1.293

F=((SSRR - SSRF)/(dfF - dfr))/MSEf
F

qf(p=.95, dfF-dfr, nrow(Data)-5)

```
Question 8)

From the plot we can observe that there is a curvy pattern as the value of Y is increasing wrt X1 till value 10 and it started decreasing after 10

```{r}
plot(X1,Y)

```
Question 9)

The estimated regression function is $Y=12.49-0.4043*X1+0.314*X2+0.00000846*X4+0.0145*X1^2$

Model3 is a good fit.

```{r}
XSq=X1^2
Model3=lm(Y~X1+X2+X4+XSq)
summary(Model3)

plot(Y,fitted(Model3))

```
Question 10)

partial F test

![Partial F Test](C:/Users/SRINU/Desktop/Fall 2022/Stats/Capture.png)

follows $F(dfF - dfr,n-p)$ Distribution

Conclusion: Since F Ratio is greater than F statistic so we reject null hypothesis so $X1^2$ is a significant term


```{r}

anova(Model2)
anova(Model3)

#From Anova Tables
SSRR=98.650#Reduced Model
SSRF=91.535#Full Model
dfF=4
dfr=3
MSEf=1.204

#Partial test
F=((SSRR - SSRF)/(dfF - dfr))/MSEf
F

qf(p=.95, dfF-dfr, nrow(Data)-5)

```
